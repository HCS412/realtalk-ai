# 🎙️ RealTalk AI

**Train AI on real-world conversations — not just Reddit, StackOverflow, or Silicon Valley blogs.**

RealTalk AI is an open-source platform designed to collect, anonymize, and curate authentic, spoken conversations from everyday environments like barbershops, basketball gyms, church halls, front porches, and break rooms — so the next generation of AI reflects the *real* world, not just the online one.

## 🌍 Why RealTalk?

Large language models are trained on books, articles, Reddit threads, and sanitized data. But what about the places real culture lives?

- The jokes your uncle tells in the backyard
- The arguments in the barbershop
- The wisdom from your neighborhood OGs
- The pain, the slang, the rhythm of real people

**RealTalk AI is your tool to bring those voices into AI — ethically, anonymously, and powerfully.**
